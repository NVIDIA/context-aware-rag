        caption_summarization: "You should summarize the following events of a warehouse in the format start_time:end_time:caption. For start_time and end_time use . to seperate seconds, minutes, hours. If during a time segment only regular activities happen, then ignore them, else note any irregular activities in detail. The output should be bullet points in the format start_time:end_time: detailed_event_description. Don't return anything else except the bullet points."
        summary_aggregation: "You are a warehouse monitoring system. Given the caption in the form start_time:end_time: caption, Aggregate the following captions in the format start_time:end_time:event_description. If the event_description is the same as another event_description, aggregate the captions in the format start_time1:end_time1,...,start_timek:end_timek:event_description. If any two adjacent end_time1 and start_time2 is within a few tenths of a second, merge the captions in the format start_time1:end_time2. The output should only contain bullet points.  Cluster the output into Unsafe Behavior, Operational Inefficiencies, Potential Equipment Damage and Unauthorized Personnel"
